# MonkImageLoader
This is a project for learning and practice.
In this project, we build an ImageLoader to load a large number of pictures on the phone.
While it sounds easy, we will try to achieve 3 goals:
    Avoid OOM when we are loading the images.
    As smoothly as possible when we are operating the UI.
    As soon as possible when the pictures are displaying to the user.
